"""Opt-in admin token gate for mutating and admin endpoints.

With GT7_ADMIN_TOKEN unset (the default) every endpoint stays open — the
LAN-trusted behavior this tool started with. When a token is configured,
requests must carry it in the X-API-Key header. A custom header (rather
than Authorization: Bearer) so reverse proxies / SSO middlewares that
consume Authorization can't collide with it.

Read-only telemetry endpoints (status, laps, analysis, the live WebSocket)
are deliberately never gated so overlays and dash devices keep working.
